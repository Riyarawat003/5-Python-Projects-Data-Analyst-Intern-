This repository includes five beginner-friendly Python projects developed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at EagleFly Solutions Pvt. Ltd. These projects solve real-world problems using core Python concepts such as conditionals, loops, and functionsâ€”without using any external libraries. The aim is to demonstrate logic building, basic data interaction, and user-focused solutions.
